        <h2>📌 How to Read the Weather Report?</h2>

        <p><strong>Condition:</strong> This describes the current weather (e.g., Clear, Cloudy, Rainy).</p>
        <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> The report gives the current temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius (e.g., It is currently 73°F out).</p>
        <p><strong>Chance of Rain:</strong> This shows the likelihood of rain (e.g., There is a 0% chance of rain means no rain expected).</p>

        <h2>🌍 Example Weather Report & What It Means</h2>
        <p>👉 <strong>"Clear. It is currently 73°F out. There is a 0% chance of rain."</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ The sky is clear, with no clouds or rain.</li>
            <li>✔ The temperature is warm and comfortable.</li>
            <li>✔ No rain expected, so it’s a great time for outdoor activities!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>💨 Wind Speed</h2>
        <p><strong>What is Wind Speed?</strong><br>
        Wind speed measures how fast the air is moving. It is usually measured in <strong>meters per second (m/s)</strong> or <strong>kilometers per hour (km/h)</strong>.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>🌬 Light winds (0-5 m/s) feel like a gentle breeze.</li>
            <li>🌪 Strong winds (above 10 m/s) can make outdoor activities difficult.</li>
            <li>⚠️ High wind speeds can lead to storms or dust storms, affecting visibility and comfort.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🌫 Air Quality Index (AQI)</h2>
        <p><strong>What is AQI?</strong><br>
        The <strong>Air Quality Index (AQI)</strong> tells how clean or polluted the air is. It ranges from <strong>0 to 500</strong>, where a lower number means better air quality.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>🟢 <strong>0-50 (Good):</strong> Air quality is excellent.</li>
            <li>🟡 <strong>51-100 (Moderate):</strong> Acceptable air quality for most people.</li>
            <li>🟠 <strong>101-150 (Unhealthy for sensitive groups):</strong> People with asthma or allergies may experience discomfort.</li>
            <li>🔴 <strong>151-200 (Unhealthy):</strong> Everyone may start experiencing health effects.</li>
            <li>💥 <strong>201+ (Very Unhealthy & Hazardous):</strong> Serious health risks, avoid outdoor activities.</li>
        </ul>
